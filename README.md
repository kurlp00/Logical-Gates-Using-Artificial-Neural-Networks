# Logical-Gates-Using-Artificial-Neural-Networks

## Computational Intelligence

### This project simulates logical gates using artificial neural network. As for now, the data in this project is just for OR gate. The artificial neural network consists of 2 input neurons because the input in logical gates is two, 1 hidden layer, 3 hidden neurons (can be configured) and 1 output neuron. This uses forward pass for computing the output and backpropagation for learning. All handcrafted using C#.

**Good things about this project**
- Does what the description says.
- Backpropagation from scratch.
- Easy to understand backpropagation and can be implemented on other inputs and outputs

**Bad things about this project**
- Input and output data needs to be interpolated. 
- Formula: _(1 - ((input - 0) / (1 - 0)) - 1)_
